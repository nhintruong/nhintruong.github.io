excerpt: 'Molecules can show stereochemistry: two molecules with the same atomic connectivity may exhibit different bioactivity due to different spatial arrangements. We propose a graph neural network architecture that utilizes a chiral-sensitive aggregation function and self-attention mechanism to improve the performance of molecular properties prediction by exploiting chiral information. Unlike many black-box deep learning models, the internals of our network are interpretable by visualizing the learned weights of the attention layers, providing better support for drug discovery.'
