Hi! I'm Nhi, a Computer Science and Economics student at DePauw University (4.0 GPA), where I'm part of the Management Fellows Program, Science Research Fellow Program, and Honor Scholar Program.

I work as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at the [Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/) under Professor [Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/), where I focus on building evaluation frameworks for large language models. My research on Vietnamese LLMs was published at **NAACL 2024** and featured in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/technology/ai-language-gap.html) and [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/improving-equity-and-access-non-english-large-language-models).

I also contributed to time series forecasting research at the [VNU-HCMUT AI Lab](https://www.hcmut.edu.vn/en), published at **ICLR 2024**, and was a Google Summer of Code contributor for [The R Project](https://www.r-project.org/).

My research interests span **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **time series forecasting**, with applications in healthcare and education. I'm enthusiastic about using data-driven technology to advance scientific discovery.
