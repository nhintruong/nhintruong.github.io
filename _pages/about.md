Hi! I'm Nhi, a Computer Science and Economics student at [DePauw University](https://www.depauw.edu/).

I currently work with Professor [Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/) at the [Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/), where I help build evaluation frameworks for large language models. Previously, I worked on time series forecasting at the [VNU-HCMUT AI Lab](https://www.hcmut.edu.vn/en) and contributed to [The R Project](https://www.r-project.org/) through Google Summer of Code.

I'm interested in **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **time series forecasting**, especially their applications in healthcare and education.
