Hi! My name is Nhi. I am an informatics specialized student at VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted. My research interests include machine learning, time series forecasting, and large language models. 
I am particularly enthusiastic about utilizing these techniques to advance medicine and scientific discovery. I have preprint research on a hybrid model for time series forecasting, and attention graph neural network for stereo-active molecules. I also contributed to research on large language models for Vietnamese.
