At the [Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/), I worked on improving the capabilities of large language models for Vietnamese, a language spoken by over 100 million people.

**Key contributions:**

- Architected a novel AI evaluation framework combining public benchmark design with private test content to prevent data contamination, achieving a 40% reduction in benchmark gaming
- Built a comprehensive evaluation framework with 10 NLP tasks (translation, summarization, Q&A, sentiment analysis) and 31 automated metrics, processing 50,000+ test samples
- Published as co-first author at **NAACL 2024** {% cite truong2024crossinglinguistic %}
